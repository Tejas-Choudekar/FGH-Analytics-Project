    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we will use a dedicated environment called \"l2rpn_neurips_2020_track1\", that has 36 substations. Grid2op comes with many different environments, with different problems etc. In this notebook, we will only mention and explain this specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach in this notebook is a loss minimization approach. We have used SARSA algorithm with Q-learning network and this new approach is called Deep SARSA Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algoritm takes current action $a$ with $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm on current state $S$. The reward $r$ and next state $S'$ is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later the current state $S$, current action $a$, reward $r$ and next state $S'$ is stored in buffer replay memory. The main idea behind the buffer replay memory is to train q-network on the experiences. The q-network will calculate q-values based on these experiences $Q(S,a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A copy of q-network is used as target network to calculate the q-values of next action $a'$ on next state $S'$ where the $a'$ is selected using $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm. The idea behind this network is that it will predict next q-values $\\hat{Q}(S',a')$ based on next actions $a'$ predicted by $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm and the next states $S'$. These q-values are then used to calculate next state-action values as $r+\\gamma.\\hat{Q}(S',a')$ which are then used to calculate loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function that we used is mean square error loss (MSE) which is calculated as $L = \\frac{1}{|K|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|K|}[(r+\\gamma.\\hat{Q}(S',a'))-Q(S,a)]^2$ Deep SARSA Algorithm will try to minimise this loss by adjusting the weights of the q-network accordingly.\n",
